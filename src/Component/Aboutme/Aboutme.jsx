     <p className='ogbeni'> Hello, I'm Ogbeni NitroEeF, a passionate and innovative web developer/designer,
        dedicated to creating user-friendly and engaging visual and functional experiences...I am motivated by a 
        desire to make a meaningful impact through design and a fascination
        with human-centered technology. 

        With a foundation in Aesthetics and well established interaction in front end development
        , i bring a unique and functional perspective to design that combines creativity with technical expertise.
        outside of design, you can find me playing indoor games like scrabble, pes /dreamleague
     or surfing the net, probably dabbling in emerging design tools and technologies 
     </p>
